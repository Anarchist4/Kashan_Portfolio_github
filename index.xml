      <description>Diverse Image Classification: Developed a deep learning model to classify 100k images of sandals, shoes, and boots using transfer learning. Transfer Learning Expertise: Leveraged pre-trained convolutional neural networks for efficient feature extraction and fine-tuning. Data Augmentation: Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization and improve classification accuracy. Hyperparameter Optimization: Experimented with various hyperparameters to fine-tune the model&amp;rsquo;s performance. Robust Evaluation: Evaluated the model&amp;rsquo;s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a dedicated test set.</description>

      <description>Data Science and Machine Learning are my passions. My name is Kashan Abdullah and I have been working in the data science field for the last one year. I have held a position in a Company that helped clients through an AI driven identity verification system. I transitioned into Data science from an Electrical Engineering background. When i was first starting out on my data science journey, I was completely lost; there were few individuals that were working in the data science field.</description>
